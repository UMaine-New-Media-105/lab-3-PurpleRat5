Repository for Lab#3 of NMD 105
-------------------------------

This repository tested our usage of creating and calling functions and writing if/ifelse conditionals

The first task was to draw a sprite that used several conditionals to change its appearance. I drew a robot

The second task was to add this sprite inside of a function and call it. My robot is now placed inside of a function and called in draw()

The Third task was to call our function using variables to change its appearance inside of the function. My robot can now change colors, scale and positions.
